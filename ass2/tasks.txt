RandomForestRegressor
ExtraTreesRegressor

####################
Questions:

1. at exactly is the difference between a RandomForestRegressor and an ExtraTreeRegressor?

2. Which of both is closer to the Criminisi/Shotton/Konokoglu forest from the lecture?

3. Which parameter settings provide satisfying results? (1. # of training samples, 2. the tree depth, 3. # of trees in a forest)

4. By tendency, are the requirements for the amount of training data larger or smaller than for our Parzen window estimator?

Steps:

1. Reuse the raccoon sampler from the previous exercise to create the actual density samples.
2. Use uniform distribution as the background. (With at least as many samples in the background distribution as in the actual distribution.)
3. First paragraph of 14.2.4.
	3.1. How to pool 2 datasets? (and correspondingly their y_values)
4. Use a random forest to fit the regression model. (RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor)
