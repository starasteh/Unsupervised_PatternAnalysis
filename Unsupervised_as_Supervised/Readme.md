Steps:

1. Reuse the raccoon sampler from the previous exercise to create the actual density samples.
2. Use uniform distribution as the background. (With at least as many samples in the background distribution as in the actual distribution.)
3. First paragraph of 14.2.4.
	3.1. How to pool 2 datasets? (and correspondingly their y_values)
4. Use a random forest to fit the regression model. (RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor)
